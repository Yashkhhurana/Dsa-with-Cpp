// Q1 : Write a program to find the product of two numbers using pointers.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int x,y;
    cin>>x>>y;
    int *P1,*P2;
    P1 = &x;
    P2 = &y;
    int ans;
    int *PtrAns = &ans;
    *PtrAns = (*P1) * (*P2);
    cout<<*PtrAns;
    
}

// Q2 : int *p, q;
p is a pointer and q is an integer.
p and q both are pointers.
P and q both are integers.
Syntax is incorrect.


Solution :
p is a pointer and q is an integer. * is grouped with variables, not data types.


//  Q3: Find the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
b = *ptr + 1;
ptr = &b;
cout << *ptr << ‘ ‘ << a << ‘ ‘ << b;
11 11 10
10 10 10
11 10 11
10 11 10

Solution :

11 10 11
ptr points to a, b = a + 1 , so ptr points to b


// Q4: Find the output of the following code snippet.
int a = 15, b = 20;
int *ptr = &a;
int *ptr2 = &b;
*ptr = *ptr2;
ptr now points to b
ptr2 now points to a
a gets value of b
b gets value of a

Solution :
a gets the value of b

// Q5: Is the following program snippet correct?

int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr;
*ptr = 5;

Solution :
The program is correct and will compile but might result in runtime error.This is
because ptr will have a garbage address which might even point to a location which
does not belong to our program and hence might result in Segmentation Fault when we
are trying to access it.
